# About Me

I code in R to make sense of data by day and have fun transforming & upcycling clothes by night.

I had never really been interested in fashion. I hated shopping for new clothes. Trying on dresses for birthday parties, graduations and other events only led to frustration as I never liked how I looked or felt. If I found something I **liked**, the article of clothing most of the time didn’t have a good fit; maybe the sleeves were too long, shoulders too wide or bust was too tight or loose. And when I found something that **fit**, the item was usually “in” or “trendy”. Pride in my uniqueness, individuality and self expression took a toll.  

Altering and creating my own clothes was never something I thought I would have the ability and time to do, but made a lot of sense for it to become an outlet for me during Covid. I thought "why don’t I learn to sew and make a dress from scratch"?

And the rest is history.
